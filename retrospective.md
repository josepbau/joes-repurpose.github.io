# Project Name: Joe's Repurposing Tutorial

What went well was recalling and being able to reference some of the examples of the files we had already created to be able to apply those to our Project 03: Final Project.

What went wrong was missing the deadline for the assignment which I thought was October 5th. Normally, I'm pretty good with taking note of deadlines and honoring them.  I believe I just got used to the fact of assignments being submitted on Sundays.

What I will do differently will use an academic calendar to not important dates for deadlines. Confirm dates and review deadline dates on a weekly basis to commit them to memory as well.
