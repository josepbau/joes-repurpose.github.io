<body> <h1> WHy Should We Repurpose Junk?
    <p>Repurposing Junk cuts down on waste and allows you to create something unique and custom. It also allows you to make something your own. The best part about repurposing something is being able to do it for free.  
        Most of the items that you will be repurposing may all be free.  I mean after all its somebody';s junk that they don't have any use for.</p>
