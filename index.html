<body> <h1> WHy Should We Repurpose Junk?
    <p>Repurposing Junk cuts down on waste and allows you to create something unique and custom. It also allows you to make something your own. The best part about repurposing something is being able to do it for free.  
     Most of the items that you will be repurposing may all be free.  I mean after all its somebody';s junk that they don't have any use for.</p>
</h2>Where can I find free Junk?
<p>There are many places to find free junk. In the beginning I would suggest asking your friend's and family.  Friend's and family are a good place to start because you may get good quality items that they feel they dont need anymore. Plus they will also feel like your doing them a huge favor or saving them a trip to the local Goodwill.  Plus they may actually feel good that it went to someone who they know and will like to see your end product.  
    Another place to start would be my favorite resource for god finds, Facebook Marketplace. This pace is untapped for modern day freebies. If you dont have a Facebook account, I recommend creating one simply for this Application integration of marketplace within Facebook.  I understand if you dont want to creat eit for social media purposes but the marketplace itself is worthy of creating one.
